# Go Backgammon Engine

A high-performance backgammon analysis engine ported from GNU Backgammon's
evaluation core, rewritten in idiomatic Go.

## Project Status: Phase 5 Complete ✅

**Completed Features:**
- Position encoding/decoding (gnubg-compatible position IDs)
- Move generation for all dice combinations
- Neural network evaluation (contact, race, crashed positions)
- Bearoff database integration (1-sided and 2-sided)
- Match equity table support
- Cube decision analysis (double/take/pass with Janowski formula)
- Match play with full MET integration (Crawford/post-Crawford)
- Monte Carlo rollouts with parallel execution
- Multi-ply evaluation (0-ply, 1-ply, 2-ply)
- Move pruning and evaluation caching
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Tutor mode (error detection, skill ratings, luck analysis)
- External player protocol (gnubg socket interface)
- SGF/MAT match file import/export

**Next Phase:** Web Service (REST API, WebSocket, Docker)

**See:** [docs/USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for complete usage instructions.

## Project Goals

1. **Standalone engine** - No GUI, no CLI parsing, just pure evaluation logic ✅
2. **Multiple interfaces** - Library, CLI tool, web service (in that order) ✅ (Library + CLI done)
3. **Maximum performance** - Leverage all available cores for rollouts ✅
4. **Validated accuracy** - Test against gnubg to ensure correctness ✅
5. **Clean API** - Easy to embed in any Go application ✅

## Target Hardware

- Memory: 32-96 GB available
- Cores: 4-6 cores (design for easy scaling)
- Rollouts: Up to 1,000 games per position

## What We're Porting from gnubg

Only the essential evaluation logic (~8,000 lines of C):

| Component | Source Files | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Neural Network | lib/neuralnet.c, lib/inputs.c | Position evaluation |
| Position Encoding | positionid.c | Board ↔ ID conversion |
| Move Generation | eval.c (GenerateMoves) | Legal move enumeration |
| Bearoff Database | bearoff.c | Endgame exact equity |
| Match Equity Tables | matchequity.c | Match play adjustments |
| Cube Decisions | eval.c (cube functions) | Double/take/pass |
| Rollouts | rollout.c (core logic) | Monte Carlo simulation |

## What We're NOT Porting

- GUI (gtk*.c, board3d/*)
- Command parser (gnubg.c command handling)
- Database/relational features
- Sound, rendering, preferences
- Python bindings
- Most of backgammon.h globals

## Core Types

```go
package engine

// Board represents checker positions for both players.
// Index 0 = bar, 1-24 = points, 25 = borne off
type Board [2][26]int8

// GameState represents the full state needed for evaluation
type GameState struct {
    Board       Board
    Turn        int    // 0 or 1
    Dice        [2]int // Current roll (0,0 if not rolled)
    CubeValue   int    // 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
    CubeOwner   int    // -1=centered, 0=player0, 1=player1
    MatchLength int    // 0 = money game
    Score       [2]int // Match score
    Crawford    bool   // Crawford game
}

// Evaluation contains equity estimates
type Evaluation struct {
    Equity      float64    // Expected value
    WinProb     float64    // P(win)
    WinG        float64    // P(win gammon)
    WinBG       float64    // P(win backgammon)
    LoseG       float64    // P(lose gammon)
    LoseBG      float64    // P(lose backgammon)
}

// Move represents a sequence of checker moves
type Move struct {
    From  [4]int8   // Starting points

    DoubleEquity float64
    NoDoubleEquity float64

type CubeAction int
const (
    NoDouble CubeAction = iota
    Double
    Take

)
```

## Performance Design

### Concurrency Model

```go
// RolloutOptions controls parallel rollout execution
type RolloutOptions struct {
    Trials      int           // Number of games (default 1000)
    Truncate    int           // Truncate at ply N (0 = play to end)
    Seed        int64         // RNG seed (0 = random)
    Workers     int           // 0 = GOMAXPROCS
    JSD         bool          // Calculate Jensen-Shannon divergence
}

// Rollout distributes trials across workers
func (e *Engine) Rollout(state *GameState, opts RolloutOptions) (*RolloutResult, error) {
    workers := opts.Workers
    if workers == 0 {
        workers = runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)
    }

    trialsPerWorker := opts.Trials / workers
    results := make(chan partialResult, workers)

    for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
        go func(seed int64) {
            // Each worker has independent RNG
            results <- e.rolloutWorker(state, trialsPerWorker, seed)
        }(opts.Seed + int64(i))
    }

    // Aggregate results...
}
```

### Memory Considerations

With 32-96 GB available, we can be generous:

| Component | Memory | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Neural net weights | ~50 MB | Loaded once, shared |
| Bearoff DB (2-sided) | ~130 MB | Loaded once, shared |
| Bearoff DB (1-sided) | ~35 MB | Loaded once, shared |
| Per-rollout state | ~1 KB | Trivial |
| Move lists | ~50 KB | Per evaluation |

**Total baseline: ~220 MB** - Plenty of headroom.

For maximum performance, we'll:
- Load all databases into memory at startup
- Use sync.Pool for frequently allocated objects
- Avoid allocations in hot paths

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Each internal package has comprehensive tests:

```go
// internal/positionid/positionid_test.go
func TestPositionIDRoundTrip(t *testing.T) {
    // Test that Encode(Decode(id)) == id for known positions
}

func TestPositionIDCompatibility(t *testing.T) {
    // Test against known gnubg position IDs
    cases := []struct{
        board Board
        id    string
    }{
        {StartingPosition, "4HPwATDgc/ABMA"},
        // ... more test cases from gnubg
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests (Compare to gnubg)

We'll create a test harness that:
1. Runs gnubg CLI with a position
2. Captures its evaluation
3. Runs our engine
4. Compares results

```bash
# scripts/compare_eval.sh
echo "set evaluation cubeful on" | gnubg -t
echo "set evaluation plies 2" | gnubg -t
echo "external posid:$1" | gnubg -t
# Parse output, compare to our engine
```

### Benchmark Tests

```go
func BenchmarkEvaluate(b *testing.B) {
    e, _ := NewEngine()
    state := StartingPosition()
    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        e.Evaluate(state)
    }
}

func BenchmarkRollout1000(b *testing.B) {
    e, _ := NewEngine()
    state := StartingPosition()
    opts := RolloutOptions{Trials: 1000}
    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        e.Rollout(state, opts)
    }
}
```

---

## Data Files

The engine needs these data files from gnubg:

| File | Size | Purpose | Embedding |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| gnubg.weights | ~50 MB | Neural net weights | Embed or load |
| gnubg_os.bd | ~35 MB | 1-sided bearoff | Embed or load |
| gnubg_ts.bd | ~130 MB | 2-sided bearoff | Load at runtime |
| g11.xml | ~10 KB | Match equity table | Embed |

For the library, we'll:
- Embed gnubg.weights and gnubg_os.bd using `//go:embed`
- Load gnubg_ts.bd from disk (optional, for more accuracy)
- Embed g11.xml (small)

---

## CLI Tool Design (Phase 3)

```bash
# Evaluate a position
$ bgengine eval --position "4HPwATDgc/ABMA:cIkqAAAAAAAA"
Equity: +0.234
  Win:    58.2% (G: 18.4%, BG: 0.8%)
  Lose:   41.8% (G: 12.1%, BG: 0.4%)

# Find best move
$ bgengine move --position "4HPwATDgc/ABMA:cIkqAAAAAAAA" --dice 3,1
Best: 8/5 6/5
  Equity: +0.312

# Cube decision
$ bgengine cube --position "4HPwATDgc/ABMA:cIkqAAAAAAAA"
Action: Double
  Double equity: +0.892
  No double:     +0.756

# Rollout
$ bgengine rollout --position "4HPwATDgc/ABMA:cIkqAAAAAAAA" --trials 1000
Rollout (1000 trials, 6 workers):
  Equity: +0.241 ± 0.012
  Time: 2.3s
```
